Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.[36] Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x[37] and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[38]

Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[39][40] In January 2017, Google announced work on a Python 2.7 to Go transcompiler to improve performance under concurrent workloads.
